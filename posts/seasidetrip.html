      <p>Seaside is a place that no one has been before me. I learned that at the airport when they said "wow we've never had someone actually come to here before, you're so cool". That's when my driver appeared, Kate White. She drives a white cab. I was tired. We got Seven Brew. ZZZZZZzzzzzzzz nap time. </p>
