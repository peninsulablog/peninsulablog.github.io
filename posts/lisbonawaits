      <p>Hello travelers! My name is Rebecca, and I am an environmental arts and humanities major at Sewanee, entering my junior year. Thanks to the Sewanee pledge, I have the opportunity to study Environmental Justice and Sustainability in Lisbon, Portugal this fall with SIT (in 16 days from now). The universe is really on my side this year, seeing as on December 16th I also have the pleasure of joining two Sewanee professors and many peers on a two week trip to New Zealand with hopes to further my grasp of coastal studies. If I am able to, I will certainly use this established blog to clue my favorite travelers (you guys) in on that trip after the fact. I ask for forgiveness from those who notice that New Zealand is not on the Iberian Peninsula. </p>
      <p>My plan is to write a lot and take a billion pictures on my waterproof Kodak Pixpro WPZ2! Expect to see a lot of art found on my travels/ inspired by my travels. Also, do not be surprised if my blog is flooded with pictures of every dog and creature that I encounter for the next four months. If you’re a student interested in or currently studying abroad, anyone interested in Portugal, or just part of my support system, this blog is definitely the place for you! Don’t be shy to sign up for email alerts. Here are some pictures from this summer that will give you a taste of my world:</p>
