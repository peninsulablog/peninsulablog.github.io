Read this to figure out how the site works!

Basically, a website is a bunch of html documents strung together. Each page you open is its own html document. We use css documents to style those pages so they don't look like this. Every blog post is its own html file!

All templates will be in the "templates" folder. 

To make a new blog post, first upload all of the images you'll want in your blog post to the "images" folder. Then, go to the "templates" folder and open the "template.html" file. This is a template blog post, with almost nothing in it, but instructions on how to make an html file. It should be pretty straightforward. Copy the contents of the file, then go to "posts" and add a new file, called "postname".html. Name it whatever you want, but keep it in all lowercase for simplicity. Then, copy the contents of the template.html file into your new .html document. Follow the instructions in the document to make your post! Make sure to commit changes, the big green button at the top, to save.

To publish your new post, you'll have to go to the posts.html file. First, copy the template post file at Follow the instructions on the notes, and copy your new post just above the top &lt;article&gt;&lt;/article&gt; element. All of the articles should have the same notes, so copy any of them. Once it's been copied and updated, commit changes and give the website a few minutes!

If you want to add new and exciting elements to your blog post, like lists and block quotes, let me know and I'd be happy to show you how. If you want to change how something looks, which would happen in the css file, let me know and we'll figure it out.

Good luck!
